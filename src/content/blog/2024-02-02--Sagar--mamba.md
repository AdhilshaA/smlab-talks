description: This talk presents a look into the Mamba architecture, a linear-time sequence modeling approach that uses selective state spaces to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of sequence modeling tasks.
---

The talk will begin with a primer on the basics of selective state models, followed by an overview of the Mamba architecture. The presentation will cover the key aspects of the model such as the scanning operation, hardware-aware memory allocations, computations, and conclude with an examination of the results presented in the paper.
