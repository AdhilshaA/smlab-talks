In continuation with our ongoing research and analysis of various actuation and control strategies for robotic prosthesis, this is the second iteration appends the talk on current state of robotic prosthetics and soft robotics. Our discussion begins with understanding prosthetics and the scope of this term followed by a discussion into neuroprosthetics. Nervous tissue typically has a very low potential for intrinsic regeneration with the primary reason being that the connections between neurons is as important for the function as the gross number of neuron in the tissue. A lot of cases of physical disability are associated with damage to nervous tissue. A way to interact with these neurons has the potential to restore function in a disabled limb. On the other hand, a means of interaction with nervous tissue can also carve a way for development of advanced brain controlled prosthetics together with potential to associate a mechanical prosthetic limb as a contributor to the cognitive sensory bank by restoring sensations such as touch, pressure, temperature etc. in a limb thatâ€™s been replaced with a mechanical prosthesis. In this talk we discuss the various control strategies for robotic prostheses along with looking at some inspiring examples of neuroprosthetics based control and sensory rehabilitation in limb amputation cases. A short discussion on cognitive rehabilitation options associated with limb loss is also included.
