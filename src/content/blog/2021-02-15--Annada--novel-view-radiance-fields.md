In this talk, I'll briefly discuss the following (a) the rendering integral (b) the radiance function and finally talk about a (c) method for synthesizing novel views of complex scenes by optimizing an underlying continuous volumetric scene function using a sparse set of input views.

**No slides are available for this talk.**
