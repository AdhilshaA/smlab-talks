description: In this talk, we will talk about the rendering and anti-aliasing equations and their approximations in real-world rendering. We will also discuss how to preserve differentiability in rendering using Feynman's differentiation under the integral sign and the Reynolds Transport Theorem.

In this weekly I will talk about the rendering equation and the anti-aliasing equation. And talk about how the anti-aliasing equation is approximated in real world and how such approximation break the differentiability of any renderer that tries to implement the anti-aliasing equation. Also I will talk about how we can mathematically preserve the differentiability by using Feynman's differentiation under the integral sign and the Reynolds Transport Theorem.
