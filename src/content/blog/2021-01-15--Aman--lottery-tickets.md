Neural networks are highly over parametrized and pruning such networks is a way to get faster inference and lower storage requirements for our networks. Winning lottery ticket is one such algorithm that prunes the network by finding the "important weights" in a network and retraining the network with these weights. We will briefly discuss the algorithm as proposed in paper 1 and 2 attached, and then try to find why it works (paper 3 and 4) and the shortcomings of the algorithm. There is a proposed algorithm in the 4th paper I have attached which tries to overcome this weakness.
