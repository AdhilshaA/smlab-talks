description: In this talk, we will talk about the recent developments and available options in the world of robotic prosthetics. We will discuss some of the challenges and initial impressions regarding the problems to be overcome in order to design a lifelike robotic prosthetic limb which is accessible to masses.

The world of accessible prosthetic limbs mostly consists of dummy legs and hands which are devoid of much function other than playing the cosmetic role of oneâ€™s structural completion. Robotic prosthetics are still this exclusive domain which is largely inaccessible to the majority due to its poor affordability. This talk is going to be an introduction to my MSc. Thesis project which aims at studying and understanding the recent developments and available options in the world of robotic prosthetics. The talk features some of the challenges and initial impressions regarding the problems to be overcome in order to design a lifelike robotic prosthetic limb which is accessible to masses.
