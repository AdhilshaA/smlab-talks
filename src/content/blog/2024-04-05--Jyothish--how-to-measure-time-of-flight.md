description: This talk delves into the ingenious methods used to measure the Time-Of-Flight (ToF) of light. It explores continuous wave time of flight (CW-ToF), Pulsed ToF (DTof), Frequency Modulated ToF (FMToF), and other machines used for 3D perception, such as wiggle-stereoscopy.

Ever wondered how we are able to measure the Time-Of-Flight of light? Well light is the fastest thing around here, and to measure how much time it took for light to bounce back from distances as small as 10 cm the stopwatch itself must be clicked twice, faster then the speed of light. So, clearly that's not how it's done. In this talk, we discuss how the simple principles of physics and electronics from High-school textbooks are utilized ingeniously to device contineous wave time of flight (CW-ToF). Principles of Pulsed ToF (DTof) , Frequency Modulated ToF (FMToF) will also be discussed for the sake of context establishment. If time permits, Other crazy machines used for 3D perception (such as wiggle-stereoscopy etc.) will be discussed.

**No slides are available for this talk.**
