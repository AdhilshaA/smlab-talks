Simultaneous Machine Translation (SiMT) involves translation of continuous stream of data. In this talk, we will discuss one of the earliest works in SiMT using NMT models. The authors showed that unlike previous methods which had two process (segmenting the continuous stream and translation of segments) of translating such data, using NMT models one can perform both the task jointly.
